    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            YeastActive dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.
        </li>

            Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bread Flour
            Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Olive Oil
            Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt
            A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).
        </li>
    
    </ul>
