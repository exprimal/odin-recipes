        <li>
            Tortillas

        </li>
        <li>
            Lime Juice
            Lime juice adds a hint of tartness.

        </li>
        <li>
            Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes

        You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making baked tortilla chips:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the Tortillas
            Cut the tortillas into triangles â€” you should be able to get about eight chips out of each tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the Chips
            Add lime juice and oil to a spray bottle and spray each chip. You can also brush the oil and lime juice mixture with a pastry brush. Sprinkle each chip with the spices.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake the Chips
            Bake the chips, flipping and re-seasoning halfway through. Make sure to check them often so they don't burn.
        </li>
    </ol>
